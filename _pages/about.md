👋🏼 Hello there, I’m Jazmin!
====

👩🏽‍💻 I'm a senior Electrical Engineering & Physics student at the [University of Missouri, Columbia](https://missouri.edu/).

🔬 My research & engineering interests are in energy harvesting for biomedical applications, PCB design, bio-microelectronics, nanotechnology, and automation. 

📚 I am also interested in STEM outreach and [inclusivity](https://engineering.missouri.edu/2022/a-family-away-from-home-feeling-at-mizzou-engineering/).
